      <p class="spread1">
        In 2021 I used to work as a cashier in a supermarket chain called
        <a href="https://panda.com.sa/en/">"Panda"</a>, and to be more precise,
        it was this specific branch called
        <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zERJXBh5RZhxVxwF7">"HyperPanda"</a>. It was
        a hectic job at times and some customers were just unbearable, but with
        the guidance of my co-workers I managed to learn how to tolerate and
        treat customers of all shapes and types. Through that job I learnt the
        importance of patience and tolerance.<br /><br />
